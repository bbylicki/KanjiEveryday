Japanese Radicals font
===========
Derived from [Source Han Sans][1], _Japanese Radicals_ is a small (54KB), custom font (_JapaneseRadicals-Regular.otf_) with full support all Japanese radicals and their variants (321 characters). EOT, TTF, SVG and WOFF versions of the font can be found in the webfonts sub-directory.

To improve compatability with legacy encodings in existing files _Japanese Radicals_ includes all the glyphs in the Unicode Kangxi Radicals (U+2F00..U+2FDF) and CJK Radicals Supplement (U+2E80..U+2EFF) character ranges as well as a small number of Han ideographs. The remaining 60 radical glyphs not available in Unicode were encoded in the Private Use Area range U+E700..U+E759 and can be viewed in the included PNG image. 

Also included is a PDF file which lists the radicals present in the font, their encodings, stroke numbers, meanings, readings and positions (a CSV version is included in the language-data directory on this repository). The _Japanese Radicals_ font can be [viewed in use on the _Kanji alive_ website][2].
